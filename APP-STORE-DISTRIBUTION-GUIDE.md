# üè™ App Store Distribution Guide - AKCB Chatbot v1.3.0

## üì± **App Store Ready Configuration**

### **Google Play Store Distribution**

#### **1. App Signing Configuration**

Create a release keystore for production signing:

```bash
# Generate release keystore (run once)
keytool -genkey -v -keystore akcb-chatbot-release.keystore -alias akcb-chatbot -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# Store keystore securely and update gradle.properties:
```

Add to `android/gradle.properties`:
```properties
MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=../akcb-chatbot-release.keystore
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=akcb-chatbot
MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=your_store_password
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password
```

#### **2. Build for Production**

```bash
# Clean and build release
cd android
./gradlew clean
./gradlew bundleRelease

# Generate APK if needed
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

#### **3. App Bundle (AAB) - Recommended**

Google Play prefers Android App Bundles (AAB) for better optimization:

```bash
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

Output: `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
